This project implements the classic Tents & Trees puzzle game using Java Swing, focusing on a Greedy algorithm–based CPU solver. The game follows standard rules such as pairing each tree with exactly one adjacent tent, preventing tents from touching, and satisfying row and column constraints. The CPU makes decisions step by step using greedy logic, applying forced row and column rules, forced tree neighbor rules, simple heuristics, and a fallback mechanism when needed. All decisions are made locally without future planning or backtracking, demonstrating how greedy strategies can be applied to constraint-based puzzle games while maintaining correct gameplay and a clear visual interface.
