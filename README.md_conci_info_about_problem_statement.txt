This project implements the classic Tents Puzzle Game in Java Swing, with the unique
requirement that the entire game logic is rebuilt using a different algorithmic strategy for
each version. Each solver Backtracking, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer,
Branch and Bound, Graph Based Matching, and Heuristics runs on the same user interface
but uses completely different underlying techniques to generate and solve puzzles. 
This demonstrates how one problem can be approached from multiple computational perspectives
while producing identical gameplay behavior, making the project both algorithmically 
rich and visually intuitive for evaluation.
